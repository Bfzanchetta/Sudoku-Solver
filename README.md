# Sudoku-Solver
Java project for ultimate OOE-solution that solves sudoku puzzles for me.

I was too tired of attempting to solve sudoku puzzles one after the other, then I decided to create a generalistic object-oriented solution in Java to do it for me.
I'm attempting to implement the solving logics that I have discovered by myself, and thus I'm not following any tutorial.
Let's see what happens.

TO-DO:
[X] Create cell
[X] Create board
[X] Create cell printable routines
[X] Create column/row printable routines
[ ] Create first rule of inference
